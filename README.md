# Snake Game
The Snake Game is a classic arcade game where the player controls a snake that moves around a board and eats food to grow longer. The objective is to avoid colliding with the walls or the snake's own body while trying to achieve the highest score possible.

This is a simple implementation of the Snake Game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Demo

## Features
- Responsive and intuitive controls: Use arrow keys or WASD keys to control the snake's movement.
- Randomized food placement: Food appears at random locations on the board for the snake to eat.
- Score tracking: The game keeps track of the player's score based on the number of food items eaten.
- Game over and reset: The game ends when the snake collides with the walls or itself. The player can reset the game to start over.
